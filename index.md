Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Atmospheric & Environmental Sciences](https://www.albany.edu/daes) 
at the [University at Albany, SUNY](https://www.albany.edu/), advised by [Dr. Brian Rose](https://brian-rose.github.io/).
I am generally interested in large-scale dynamics and global climate change. In my current research, I use climate models to 
explore atmosphere–ocean–sea-ice interactions in the southern high latitudes.

I also have an interest in open science and contribute regularly to [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/), which is both a collection of geoscientific Python tutorials and a community of people passionate about Python and open, reproducible science.
